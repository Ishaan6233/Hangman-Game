# Hangman-Game
This project is a command-line based Hangman game built using Python. The game allows players to guess letters in a hidden word, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost. The game provides hints for each word and keeps track of incorrect guesses visually using a hangman graphic.
